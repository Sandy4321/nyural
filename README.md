# Nyural
Deep Neural Network Trainer based on Hessian-free Optimization based onã€€Hessianfree Python implementation from [hessianfree](https://github.com/drasmuss/hessianfree) 

Martens, J. (2010). Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning.

This is WIP, moving the code from matlab to python & pycuda.
Scaffolding based on [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) from Berkeley Vision and Learning Center(BVLC).

How to Use:
make
~/pathto/nyural.py train/test -solver (pathtosolver)
